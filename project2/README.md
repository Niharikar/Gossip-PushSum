**Run the code**
`./project2 numNodes topology algorithm`

## 1. What is working

4 topologies have been implemented namely:
 1. Line
 2. Full
 3. 2D
 4. Imperfect 2D

 All of these topologies are working for both Gossip and Push Sum algorithm.

 ## 2. What is the largest network you managed to deal with for each type of topology and algorithm

______  gossip | push-sum |
line  |  70   |   70   |
2D    |  600  |   700  |
imp2D |  2000 |   3000 |
full  |  79000|   67000|
